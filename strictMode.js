/*  Strict mode makes several changes to normal JavaScript semantics. 
    First, strict mode eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing 
    them to throw errors. Second, strict mode fixes mistakes that make it 
    difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: 
    strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical 
    code that's not strict mode. Third, strict mode prohibits some syntax 
    likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.
